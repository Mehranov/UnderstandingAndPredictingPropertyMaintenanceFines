# UnderstandingAndPredictingPropertyMaintenanceFines
For this project, we create a function that trains a model to predict blight ticket compliance in Detroit using train.csv. Using this model, we return a series with the data being the probability that each corresponding ticket from test.csv will be paid, and the index being the ticket_id.

In order to run this code, download all files in this directory into a directory in your local machine, then run Assignment4_complete.ipynb. 

The accuracy of this model based on roc curve is 81%.

This is the final project to complete the course "Applied machine learning with python" from the specialization "Applied data science with python". The requirement to achieve full score for this project was 75% accuracy. I managed to achieve 81%.
